## Description

Unlock the full potential of your Apple Silicon-powered M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max MacBook Pros by leveraging TensorFlow, the open-source machine learning framework. This guide provides an optimized environment for setting up and running TensorFlow on Apple's cutting-edge M4 chips.

## Key Features

1. **Efficient ML Workflows:** Streamline your machine learning workflows on Apple Silicon for enhanced efficiency and performance.
2. **Tailored Configurations:** Discover configurations and settings specifically designed for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max MacBook Pros, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
3. **Performance Boost:** Leverage the native capabilities of Apple Silicon to achieve accelerated training and inference speeds, tapping into the computational prowess of your M4 MacBook Pro.
4. **Compatibility and Updates:** Stay up-to-date with the latest TensorFlow releases and compatibility updates tailored for Apple Silicon architecture.

## Getting Started
Follow all the necessary steps mentioned below.

## Steps

1. Install Homebrew from [here](https://brew.sh).
2. [Download Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh) for macOS arm64 chips.
3. Install Miniforge3 into the home directory of your MacBook Pro.
4. Type the following Bash code in the terminal:
```bash
sh ~/Downloads/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh
source ~/miniforge3/bin/activate
```
5. Restart the terminal to prevent any errors.
6. Create a new directory to set up the custom TensorFlow environment:
```bash
mkdir tensorflow-test
cd tensorflow-test
```
7. Type `ls` in the terminal to crosscheck the current directory.
8. Initialize and activate the Conda environment:
```bash
conda create --prefix ./env python=3.8
conda activate ./env
```
9. Install TensorFlow dependencies from Apple Conda:
```bash
conda install -c apple tensorflow-deps
```
10. Install base TensorFlow:
```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow-macos
```
11. Install Apple's `tensorflow-metal` to utilize Apple Metal (Apple's GPU framework) for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max GPU access:
```bash
python -m pip install tensorflow-metal
```
12. Install data science packages:
```bash
conda install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
13. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
14. Type the following code to check TensorFlow version/GPU access:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sklearn
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check for TensorFlow GPU access
print(f"TensorFlow has access to the following devices:\n{tf.config.list_physical_devices()}")

# See TensorFlow version
print(f"TensorFlow version: {tf.__version__}")
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If you encounter memory errors, try reducing batch sizes.
- For GPU-related issues, ensure `tensorflow-metal` is properly installed.
- Clear the kernel and restart Jupyter Notebook if you experience unexpected behavior.
- Remember to periodically check Appleâ€™s developer resources and TensorFlow documentation for updates and optimizations specific to Apple Silicon architecture.

## Next Steps

With your environment set up, you can now:

- Start developing and training machine learning models.
- Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models.
- Explore TensorFlowâ€™s advanced features like TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.
- Begin working with custom datasets and model architectures.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
